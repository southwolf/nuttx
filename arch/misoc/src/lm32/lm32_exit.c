 * Name: _exit
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function causes the currently executing task to cease
 *   to exist.  This is a special case of task_delete() where the task to
 *   be deleted is the currently executing task.  It is more complex because
 *   a context switch must be perform to the next ready to run task.
